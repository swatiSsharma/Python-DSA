    "Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.\n",

    "Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]\n",

    "There are 2 cases to consider here, if the peak exists in the left half or right half\n",
    "If your middle element is less than the right side element then there exists a peak on the right side. (eg. First case)\n",
    "If your middle element is less than the left element then there exists a peak on the left side (eg. Second case), else you are at a peak hence return.\n",
    "Now the edge case for this check is if we keep checking left side we will reach 0 and if we keep checking the right side we will reach the end. Hence we add that condition in the above checks.\n",
