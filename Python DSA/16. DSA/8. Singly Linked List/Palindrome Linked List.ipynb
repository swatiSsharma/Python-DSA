    "The time complexity of the is_palindrome method in the provided code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing all elements onto the stack: In the first loop of the is_palindrome method, we iterate through all nodes of the linked list once and push their values onto the stack. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.\n",
    "Comparing elements: In the second loop, we again iterate through all nodes of the linked list once, popping elements from the stack and comparing them with the elements in the linked list. Each comparison operation has a constant time complexity of O(1). Since we perform this comparison for each node in the linked list, the overall time complexity of this step is O(n).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Space complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the provided code is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack space: We use a stack to store the values of all nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, the stack will contain all elements of the linked list. Since each node's value needs to be stored in the stack, the space complexity required for the stack is directly proportional to the number of nodes in the linked list, resulting in O(n) space complexity.\n",
    "Other variables: Apart from the stack, we use a few additional variables like current to iterate through the linked list. These variables require a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the linked list. Therefore, their contribution to space complexity is negligible and can be considered O(1).\n",
    "Since the dominating factor in terms of space complexity is the stack, which requires O(n) space, the overall space complexity of the code is O(n).\n"
