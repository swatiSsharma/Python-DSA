a mod b = a − [a//b] * b
Division:
 −16 ÷ 5 = −3.2

Integer Division (Floor Division):
The floor division operator (//) gives the largest integer that is less than or equal to the result of the division.
−16 // 5 = −4

Modulo Operation (Remainder):
The modulo operator (%) gives the remainder after division.
−16 mod 5 = 4

(−16mod5)=−16−⌊ 5−16​]⌋⋅5
So, (-16 % 5) gives a result of 4 because that is the remainder when you divide -16 by 5.
