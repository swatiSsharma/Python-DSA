# Properties of String

'''
Strings in Python have several important properties that make them versatile and widely used in programming. Here are some
key properties of strings in Python:
'''
# Immutable:
'''
Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. You cannot modify individual 
characters in a string directly. Instead, you create a new string.
'''
# Sequence Type:
'''
Strings are sequences of characters and, as such, support common sequence operations like indexing, slicing, and 
iteration.
'''
# Enclosed in Quotes:
'''
Strings are created by enclosing characters in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Triple quotes (\'\'\' or 
""") are used for multi-line strings.
'''

# Indexing:

'''
You can access individual characters in a string using positive and negative indices. Positive indices start from 0 for 
the first character, while negative indices start from -1 for the last character.
'''

# Slicing:
'''
Strings support slicing to extract a portion of the string. The syntax is start:stop:step.
'''
# Concatenation:
'''
Strings can be concatenated using the + operator. This involves combining two or more strings to create a new string.
'''
# Length:
'''
The len() function can be used to determine the length (number of characters) of a string.
'''
# String Methods:
'''
Strings have a variety of built-in methods for common operations, such as converting case (upper(), lower()), searching 
for substrings (find(), index()), splitting (split()), stripping whitespace (strip()), and more.
'''
# Escape Characters:
'''
Strings can include special characters using escape sequences (e.g., \n for a newline, \t for a tab).
'''
# Formatted Strings:
'''
Python supports various string formatting techniques, including %-formatting, str.format(), and f-strings (formatted 
string literals).
'''
# Unicode Support:
'''
Python strings are Unicode-based, allowing the representation of characters from various languages and scripts.
'''
# Versatility:
'''
Strings are versatile and widely used in programming for tasks such as text processing, data manipulation, input/output 
operations, and more.
