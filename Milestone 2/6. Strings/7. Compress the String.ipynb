    "# 7. Compress the String\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this \"xxxxx\" with \"x5\".\n",
    "  The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than or equal to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The output contains the string after compression printed in single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "0 <= N <= 10^6\n",
    "\n",
    "Where 'N' is the length of the input string.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the given string 'a' is repeated 3 times, 'b' is repeated 2 times, 'c' is repeated 2 times and 'd', 's' and 'a' and occuring 1 time hence no compression for last 3 characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the given string 'a' is repeated 3 times, 'b' is repeated 2 times, 'c' is occuring single time, 'd' is repeating 2 times and 'e' is repeating 5times."
