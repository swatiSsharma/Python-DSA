    "# Selection Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection sort** is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we will select the range of the unsorted array using a loop (say i) that indicates the starting index of the range.\n",
    "The loop will run forward from 0 to n-1. The value i = 0 means the range is from 0 to n-1, and similarly, i = 1 means the range is from 1 to n-1, and so on.\n",
    "***(Initially, the range will be the whole array starting from the first index.)***\n",
    "- Now, in each iteration, we will select the minimum element from the range of the unsorted array using an inner loop.\n",
    "- After that, we will swap the minimum element with the first element of the selected range(in step 1). \n",
    "- Finally, after each iteration, we will find that the array is sorted up to the first index of the range. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  \n",
    "***Here, after each iteration, the array becomes sorted up to the first index of the range. That is why the starting index of the range increases by 1 after each iteration. This increment is achieved by the outer loop and the starting index is represented by variable i in the following code. And the inner loop(i.e. j) helps to find the minimum element of the range [i…..n-1].***"

    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal or same keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.\n",
    "Any comparison based sorting algorithm which is not stable by nature can be modified to be stable by changing the key comparison operation so that the comparison of two keys considers position as a factor for objects with equal key or by tweaking it in a way such that its meaning doesn’t change and it becomes stable as well.\n",

    "Stable Selection Sort would have produced\n",
    "Output : 1 2 3 4A 4B 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "Selection sort works by finding the minimum element and then inserting it in its correct position by swapping with the element which is in the position of this minimum element. This is what makes it unstable.\n",
    "Swapping might impact in pushing a key(let’s say A) to a position greater than the key(let’s say B) which are equal keys. which makes them out of desired order. \n",
    "In the above example 4A was pushed after 4B and after complete sorting this 4A remains after this 4B. Hence resulting in unstability.\n",
    "Selection sort can be made Stable if instead of swapping, the minimum element is placed in its position without swapping i.e. by placing the number in its position by pushing every element one step forward(shift all elements to left by 1). \n",
