    "\n",
    "Given a NumPy matrix of shape (n, n), remove all the odd elements from the matrix and return a new matrix of shape (k, k) consisting of all the remaining even elements from the original matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format**\n",
    "```\n",
    "A 2d list is taken as input which is first typecasted to a NumPy array and then passed to the function as argument.\n",

    "**Sample Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 5x5 matrix when we removed all the odd numbers we were left with 9 numbers, and hence 9 numbers can be converted to (3x3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Assume that the number of even elements in the given matrix will always be a perfect square. Also observe that the relative order of elements in the new matrix is preserved as it was in the original matrix ie. the first 4 is before 8 in the matrix as it was in the originalÂ matrix."
